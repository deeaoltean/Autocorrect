    Functions:
    
createDictionary	-----> Creates a dictionary that contains N lists. Each list
                         is initialised with the value NULL. 
          
Delete	-----> Deletes the last element of a list, if the number of cells
               exceeds the N value.
               
Remove	-----> Determines the total number of cells and deletes the last cell 
               of each list, if the total number exceeds the value 2 * N.
 
newElement	-----> Creates a new cell in which the new information will be 
                   stored.
                   
addBefore	-----> Changes the links of the cells so that the new element is
                 added before a specific one.
               
addAfter	-----> Changes the links of the cells so that the new element is
                 added after the last element of the list.
                 
sameElement	-----> Changes the frequency of the element and places it in the
                   correct order into the list.
                   
checkLast	-----> Places the new element in the correct place, concerning 
                 frequency, value and key in comparison with the last 
                 element, only if it was not added before.
                 
ListIndex	-----> Determines the index of a list based on a given key.The 
                 remainder of the sum of ASCII values of all characters 
                 of the key divided by the total number of lists.
              
addElement	-----> Adds a new element to the list, placing it in the right
                   place. The elements shold be ordered descending by 
                   frequency and if two elements have the same frequency,
                   they should be sorted alfabetically by value and 
                   then by key. If two elements match, the new frequency 
                   will be added. Each element will be added after checking
                   the efficency conditions of the dictionary.
                 
removeElement	-----> Deletes an element with a given key and value from the
                     dictionary.

printDictionary	----->  Prints the elements of a dictionary.

sort	-----> If the frequency of the element was changed and it no longer
             respects the sorting rule, it will be removed and added in the
             correct place.
             
get	-----> Creates a doubly linked list that contains the elements with a 
           specific key. The frequency of each element is increased by one
           and the cells will be sorted accordind to the sorting rule in 
           the dictionary. Each element will be removed and added to the 
           right place in the dictionary.
           
printValue	-----> Prints the elements with a specific value from the 
                   dictionary.
                   
printFrequency	-----> Prints the elements with a specific frequency from
                       the dictionary.

unionValues	-----> Creates a doubly linked list that contains the elements with
                   a specific value in the dictionary.   
                   
unionMaxFrequencies	-----> Creates a doubly linked list that contains the 
                           elements with the maximum frequency of each list.
                           The maximum frequency is located on the first 
                           position of each list.
                           
reverseLists -----> Creates a new dictionary that has the lists reversed.

printList -----> Prints the elements of a specific list.

freeList -----> Frees the memory of a list.

freeDictionary -----> Frees the memory of a dictionary.
